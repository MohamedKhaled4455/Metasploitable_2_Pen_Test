# Metasploitable_2_Pen_Test

- This penetration testing report focuses on the Metasploitable 2 machine. It was a collaborative project completed by a team of six individuals as part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI).
- The team utilized Nessus as an automated vulnerability scanning tool and employed Metasploit in various scenarios. Additionally, manual searches were conducted for CVEs and exploits targeting specific services running on particular ports.
